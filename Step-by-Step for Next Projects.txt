Step-by-Step for Next Projects

Let’s say your next project is hello-world.

1️⃣ Place the new project inside your local repo
D:\MASHUP\React\hello-world

Make sure it has its normal structure (src/, public/, package.json, etc.)

Do NOT initialize Git inside this folder — Git should only exist at the repo root (D:\MASHUP\React\.git)

Important: If you already ran npx create-react-app hello-world, run it like this to avoid inner .git:

npx create-react-app hello-world --no-git
2️⃣ Stage the folder for Git

From the root of your repo:

cd D:\MASHUP\React
git add hello-world

Only the folder you want is staged

Nothing else will be affected

3️⃣ Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add hello-world project"

This will commit only the hello-world folder

4️⃣ Push to GitHub
git push origin main

✅ Now GitHub will show:

React (repo)
 ├─ welcomecard/
 └─ hello-world/

Each project is its own folder

All files inside each project are visible

No right-arrow icons or submodule issues

⚡ Best Practices Going Forward

Always work from the root repo folder (D:\MASHUP\React)

Never initialize Git inside individual projects (--no-git with create-react-app)

Stage only the project folder you want to push:

git add project-folder

Commit and push after adding a project

Use .gitignore to avoid pushing node_modules/
